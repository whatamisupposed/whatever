    <h1>Emily Twyman</h1>
    <h2>Feel free to ignore anything weird I might do.</h2>
    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <p>I like art, and I'll use any <span>medium.</span><br /> 
         <pre> I also like reading.</pre> <hr />
        But most of all, I like sleeping. It counts as a hobby
    because I don't get to do it as much as I like. </p>
